\section{Methodology}
\subsection{System overview}
1. Distance matrix computation

2. Clustering

3. Outlier detection
compare it with all the clusters to decide whether it belongs to a normal connection or a intrusion.

Proposed system

for training data

dataset -> pre-processing -> em algorithm
dataset -> pre-processing -> classification

\subsection{Definition of anomaly}
I therefore chose the unsupervised definition of 
anomalies:
frequently occurred patterns are normal
and the pattern dissimiliar to the majority 
of normal patterns in anomalous.

\subsection{Pre-processing}
\subsubsection{Discretization}
without protocol, attack type, difficulty.
categorical value - 
big number - 

\subsection{Learning similarity function}
EM algorithm to learn the cost function.

E-step
M-step

\subsection{Measuring similarity}
based on weight, cos metric, 8-neighborhood
distance based 

\subsection{Clustering network connections}
\subsubsection{Affinity matrix computation}
Clustering network connections.

\subsubsection{Spectral clustering algorithm}
Normalized cut

\subsubsection{Choosing representative of clusters}

\subsection{Detecting anomaly from clusters}
number of clusters : eigenvalue
k-means
