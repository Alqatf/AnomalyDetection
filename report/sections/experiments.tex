\section{Experiments}
I performed experiments to evaluate the performances of similarity measures and algorithms in Section~\ref{sec:connectionsimilarity}.
\newline
In Section~\ref{subsec:datasetandsetup}, I describe the dataset that I used for the experiements.\newline
In Section~\ref{subsec:preprocessing}, I describe data pre-processing over the dataset.\newline
In Section~\ref{subsec:detectinganomalies}, I evaluate how successful the algorithms are in detecting different types of anomalies.

\subsection{Dataset and Setup}
\label{subsec:datasetandsetup}
The KDD 99 dataset is mainly used for a network-based intrusion detection algorithm evaluation \cite{tavallaee09}. 
I select the NSL-KDD dataset, which is an up-to-date version of the KDD 99 dataset, as an effective benchmark. 
% Since the NSL-KDD dataset solves issues in the KDD 99 dataset, I use the dataset as an effective benchmark. 
Its relevance of each feature in the dataset is also studied \cite{olusola10} \cite{kayacik05}. 
% All source code is on the Internet. 
% I use NSL-KDD99 Dataset for the report.

\caption{Overview of Knowledge Discovery System}
\label{fig:refSingleRobot1}
\end{figure}
The intrusion detection system should find specific kinds of abnomal traffic e.g. a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
It should check if these new sets of monitoring network traffic show similar properties as the orignal data or not as well. 
I construct the system similar to the knowledge discovery system \cite{fayyad96} because it is widely used among intrusion detection systems. 
A new approach to construct a pairwise similarity matrix is that it compares their probability in pairwise not its attributes directly. 
For this, the system includes gaussian mixture models for attributes and classes to calculate the probability for data point as I stated before. 
%The EM approach is used to fit those models and is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum on given input. 
With those components, we measure a score for each attributes, and those scores are weighted based on their importance in the dataset \cite{kayacik05}.
%to get 2D data where x-axis is a score for normal connection similarity and y-axis is a score for known abnormal connection similarity. 
The experiment suggests that such local optimum can effectively seperate different connections and most of unknown classes.

%\end{figure}

%In order for spectral anaysis, we need to make a sparse affinity matrix from transported data. 
%We can compute a sparse affinity matrix from a pairwise similarity matrix. 
After we have a pairwise similarity matrix, one way to convert similarity matrix to a sparse affinity matrix is that dealing with the affinities for $k$ nearest neighborhood, and set all other values for current data point to zero. 
I choose $k = 8$ because it is commonly used in spectral clustering approaches. 

% Altho require non-convex boundaries,
%\subsection{Computing affinity matrix}
%%The processing steps of the approach can be summerized as follows:
%%1) Training mixture model with training set containing records of both normal and anomalous connections.
%%2) The data are divided into different clusters for normal and anomalous connections using Spectral clustering algorithm.
%\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item categorical value to integer e.g.) service-type (ftp-data,http,etc).
%\item log of big number e.g.) duration, src-bytes.
%\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Affinity matrix computation}
%The data points are associated with each other by pairwise similarity.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Construct similarity matrix with distance metric.
%\item Construct affinity matrix from similarity matrix with 8-nearest neighbors algorithm.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Pre-processing}
\label{subsec:preprocessing}
A set of network connections $D_{\text{train}}$ and $D_{\text{test}}$ can be extracted from the NSL-KDD dataset. 
Each connection $D_i = (y, (\theta_{1}, \cdots, \theta_{39}))$ consists of a class label \\ 
$y \in Y=\{\text{normal},\text{anomaly}_1,\cdots,\text{anomaly}_{34}\}$ and a feature attributes $(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_{39})$. 

$D_{\text{train}}$ has 22 types of known anomaly and $D_{\text{test}}$ has 39 types of known and unknown anomaly which can be seen in Table~\ref{fig:anomalyclasses}. 
Three of feature attributes are categorical values and ten of them are large numbers which requires data-preprocessing. 
Those of three are converted from categorical values into interger values. 
Preprocessing work applies log probability on large numbers $\hat{\lambda_{j}} = \log (\lambda_{j})$ where $j$ is an index of large number attributes. 
Each attributes' probability density can be learned by EM algorithm that can be used to calculate a log-likelihood score as it stated in Section~\ref{subsec:normalabnormalsimilarity}

\subsection{Detecting Anomalies}
\label{subsec:detectinganomalies}
In this section, I describe how a sparse affinity matrix can be used to detect point and collective anomalies. 
In the following experiments, I divide experiments for known anomalies and unknown anomalies. 

\subsubsection{Known Anomalies}
We can see that trained normal and abnormal similarity functions are sensitive to known anomalies in the testset - their scores are similar to known anomalies and dissimilar to known normal connections. 
%normal and abnormal connections similarity are sensitive to known anomalies. 
It shows how much trained similarity functions capture the effects of an known anomalies. 
% The similarity coputed by mixture models gives similarity scores that are used to find k nearest neighborhood.
For most of classes, similarity of their points is very close to either known normal or abnormal connections. 
%In summary, all the class successfully detect known anomalies in spectral approach. 
However this approach does not work if the number of intrusions are insufficient because those classes are not well trained in mixture models, and data points tend to assigned to different clusters.

\subsubsection{Unknown Anomalies}
We see that normal and abnormal connection similarity are also sensitive to most of unknown anomaly. 
However, we have four classes that are similar to normal connections. 
Connection density similarity measure is sensitive in this type of anomaly if it is above its threshold. 

13 out of 17 unknown anomalies such as "processtable" class are similar to known anomalies. 
Therefore we can detect them with exactly same way what it have done to known anomalies. 
Those results are good as known anomalies.

However 4 out of 17 are close to the normal connections in the trainingset. 
In that case, a cluster resulted by spectral clustering is denser than normal case can be detected by density based algorithm if we compare with mixture density generated by normal connections only. 
So with those prior knowledge we can use a spectral approach to find abnormal clusters which is originally classified as normal clusters.

\end{figure}

The performance of density approach is not as good as previous one, and we can see that it is not able to detect "sendmail" class which is too few to form enough density.

%4 out of 17 are close to known normal connections. 
%We can not detect them with exactly same way what it have done to known anomalies since abnormal and normal connections are mixed together.
