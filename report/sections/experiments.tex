\section{Experiments}
I performed experiments to evaluate the performances.

\subsection{Dataset and Setup}
For experiments, I select KDD Data set. 
KDDCUP'99 data set is widely used for network-based anomaly detection. New version of KDD data set, NSL-KDD which has advantages over the original data set, is used in this report as an effective benchmark.


The processing steps of the appoach can be summerized as follows:
1) Training data containing records of both normal and anomalous connections.
2) The data are divided into different clusters for normal and anomalous connections using Spectral clustering algorithm.

%\subsection{Step 1. Affinity matrix}
%\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item categorical value to integer e.g.) service-type (ftp-data,http,etc).
%\item log of big number e.g.) duration, src-bytes.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{Learning similarity}
%EM algorithms to learn similarity. Learned 234(=2 x 3 x 39) Gaussian mixture model in total.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 2 : one for normal, one for abnormal.
%\item 3 : each per each protocol e.g.) udp, icmp, tcp.
%\item 39 : for all attributes.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{Measuring similarity}
%Gaussian mixture models from training set helps to measure those two similarity per each connection.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Similarity to known normal behavior.
%\item Similarity to known abnormal behavior.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{Affinity matrix computation}
%The data points are associated with each other by pairwise similarity.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Construct similarity matrix with distance metric.
%\item Construct affinity matrix from similarity matrix with 8-nearest neighbors algorithm.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Step 2. Clustering}
%\subsubsection{Number of clusters prediction}
%Predict number of clusters based on the eigengap.
%\subsubsection{Spectral clustering algorithm}
%Normalized cut algorithm. \cite{jianbo00}
%\subsubsection{Representative of clusters}
%Clusters are represented by the mean and variance.
%
%\subsection{Step 3. Detecting anomaly from clusters}
%Distance based outlier detection is used.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item It do not require any prior knowledge.
%\item k-nearest neighbor outlier detection algorithm. \cite{knorr00}
%\end{itemize}
