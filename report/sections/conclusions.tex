Spectral approach for intrusion detection is presented. 
%The proposed algorithm has the same detection performace as (sth), but it is (sth) efficient.
%Expereimental results on NSL-KDD data set indicate that (sth) 
%The fact that the number of "" does not depend on the 
%However, its performance ""
%Due to limitations of existing "", the proposed (sth) is not applicable when the data have (sth).
%The approximated k-NN might improve the applicability.
So multiclass spectral clustering is recommended. 

% (Future work)
%% Outline what needs to/can be done in the future.
Future work on robust multi-class approach is needed. 
More specifically, it would be interesting to design an algorithm with robust eigensolver, where the most noise will have the highest influence on the clustering performance. 
In addtion, an extension of density sensitive similarity function is also worth considering.
