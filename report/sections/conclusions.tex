\section{Conclusion}
% Summarize the entire report. 
(Summarize the entire report)
%A framework for "" is presented.
%The proposed algorithm has the same detection performace as (sth), but it is (sth) efficient.
%Expereimental results on NSL-KDD data set indicate that (sth) 
%The fact that the number of "" does not depend on the 
%However, its performance ""
%Due to limitations of existing "", the proposed (sth) is not applicable when the data have (sth).
%The approximated k-NN might improve the applicability.

(Future work)
%% Outline what needs to/can be done in the future.
%Future work on (sth) is needed. More specifically, it would be interesting to design an algorithm with (sth), where the most (sth) will have the highest influence on the local density estimation.
%In addtion, an extension of (sth) to create "" is also worth considering. (salability, sensitivity, coverage)
