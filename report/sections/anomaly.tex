\section{Potential anomalies}
\label{sec:potentialanomalies}
A potential anomaly occurs when a data point is \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item is similar to known anomalies %dissimilar to normal connections,
or 
\item is similar to known normal behaviours but within unexpectedly high density.
Table~\ref{fig:anomalyclasses} shows an example of the types of anomalies in the NSL-KDD dataset. 
%\item known anomalies which is similar to known abnormalies, %dissimilar to normal connections,
%\item unknown anomalies which is similar to known abnormalies, %or dissimilar to normal connections,
%\item or unknown anomalies which is similar to known normal behaviours but with very higher density.
\end{inparaenum} 
A detail of the dataset is specified in Section~\ref{subsec:datasetandsetup}. 

The goal of this report is to detect network intrusions on a computer system. 
We here give examples of this types of anomalies from the NSL-KDD dataset \cite{tavallaee09}. 
The dataset is for building an intrusion detection task to detect network anomalies which are possible network attacks. 
It contains 22 known anomalies and 13 unknown anomalies which are similar to known anomalies. 
It also contains four more unknown anomalies, but they are similar to normal data points.
