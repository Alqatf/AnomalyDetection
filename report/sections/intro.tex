\section{Introduction}
% What is NIDS?
Network intrusion detection refers detection of malcious activity in computer related system. 
An intrusion is different from the normal behavior of the system, and hence anomaly detection techniques are applicable in intrusion detection domain. \cite{chandola09}
% Why it is important?
It is important in a computer security perspective. 
Fraud detection algorithm is one of the most common external and internal discovery methods in industry.
It only quick and automated detection method that company can do also.\cite{verizon14} 
% Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior\cite{chandola09}. 
%The importance of anomaly detection is due to the fact that anomalies in data translate to significant actionable information in a wide variety of application domains\cite{chandola09}. 
% Why it is hard to solve?
It is hard to detect intrusion simply by examining few dataset. 
Collective anomalies are hard to find and intrusion anomalies looks close to normal behavior to evade the existing detection solutions\cite{chandola09}. 
Moreover, the detection of new attacks which show a unprecedent behavior is hard. 
A metric that is too sensitive to differences will yield many false alarm. Similary a metric that is not sensitive enough will yield many false negatives.
Normal user behaviours can be arbitrary and various because labeled data corresponding to normal behaviour is fully available while labels for intrusions are rare but dangerous. 
% What would be covered?
In this report, I will study the problem of intrusion detection in spectral clustering. 
Such intrusions represent significant deviations from "normal" patterns in the spectral approach. 
%Some example of such deviations are as follows :
