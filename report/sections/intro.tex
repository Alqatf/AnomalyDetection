\section{Introduction}
Network intrusion detection system deals with detecting intrusions in network data. It is important in a computer security perspective. Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior\cite{chandola09}. Intrusion detection refers detection of malcious activity in computer related system. An intrusion is different from the normal behavior of the system, and hence anomaly detection techniques are applicable in intrusion detection domain. \cite{chandola09}

The importance of anomaly detection is due to the fact that anomalies in data translate to significant actionable information in a wide variety of application domains\cite{chandola09}. Collective anomalies are hard to find and intrusion anomalies looks close to normal behavior to evade the existing intrusion detection solutions\cite{chandola09}.
