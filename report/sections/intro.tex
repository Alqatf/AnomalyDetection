\section{Introduction}
% What is NIDS?
Network intrusion detection refers to the detection of malcious activity in computer system. 
An intrusion is different from the normal behavior of the system, and hence anomaly detection techniques are applicable in the intrusion detection domain \cite{chandola09}.

% Why it is important?
Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is important in a computer security perspective. 
It is one of the most common external and internal discovery methods in industry, and only quick and automated detection method that company can do \cite{verizon14}. 
% Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior \cite{chandola09}. 
%The importance of anomaly detection is due to the fact that anomalies in data translate to significant actionable information in a wide variety of application domains \cite{chandola09}. 

% Why it is hard to solve?
It is hard to detect intrusion because the training data for an anomaly detection system are very asymmetric with very few and very diverse observed anomalies and a much larget set of normal cases. 
%simply by examining dataset. 
Collective anomalies are hard to find and intrusion anomalies looks close to normal behavior to evade the existing detection solutions \cite{chandola09}. 
Moreover, the detection of new attacks which show a unprecedent behavior is also hard. 
A metric that is too sensitive to differences will yield many false alarms. 
Similary a metric that is not sensitive enough will yield many missed detections.
Normal user behaviours can be arbitrary and various because labeled data corresponding to normal behaviour is fully available while labels for intrusions are rare but dangerous. 
% What would be covered?
In this report, I will study the problem of intrusion detection using a spectral approach. 
% Such intrusions represent significant deviations from "normal" patterns in the spectral approach. 
%Some example of such deviations are as follows :
