\section{Introduction}

Network intrusion detection system.

\begin{itemize}
\item This system deals with detecting intrusions in network data. Point anomalies and collective anomalies.
\item It is important in a computer security perspective
\end{itemize}

What is Anomaly detection

\begin{itemize}
\item Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. \cite{chandola09}
\item Intrusion detection refers detection of malcious activity in computer related system. An intrusion is different from the normal behavior of the system, and hence anomaly detection techniques are applicable in intrusion detection domain. \cite{chandola09}
\end{itemize}

why is it important

\begin{itemize}
\item The importance of anomaly detection is due to the fact that anomalies in data translate to significant actionable information in a wide variety of application domains \cite{chandola09}
\end{itemize}

why is it hard not solved yet. \cite{chandola09}

\begin{itemize}
\item point anomaly.
\item collective anomalies - looks close to normal behavior to evade the existing intrusion detection solutions.
\end{itemize}
