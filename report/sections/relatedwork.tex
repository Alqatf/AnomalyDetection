Semi-supervised or unsupervised approaches are preferred in this domain\cite{chandola09} because labled data corresponding to normal behaviour is available while labels for intrusions are not. Different approaches to network intrusion detection systems, such as \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)] \item statistical profiling using histogram, \item mixture of models, \item neural networks, \item support vector machines, and \item rule-based system\end{inparaenum}. NSL-KDD99 Dataset is mainly used in this subject\cite{tavallaee09}. The relevance of each feature in the data set is also studied\cite{olusola10} \cite{kayacik05}. Spectral clustering algorithm is mainly applied to image clustering problem and it helps to isolate point and collective outliers.
