KDD99 Dataset.

\begin{itemize}
\item a statistical analysis \cite{tavallaee09}
\item the relevance of each feature in the data set \cite{olusola10} \cite{kayacik05}
\end{itemize}

Similar approaches to network intrusion detection systems.

\begin{itemize}
\item Labled data corresponding to normal behaviour is available while labels for intrusions are not. So semi-supervised or unsupervised approaches are preferred in this domain. \cite{chandola09}
\end{itemize}

Different approaches to network intrusion detection systems.

\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical profiling using histogram
\item Mixture of models
\item neural networks
\item support vector machines
\item rule-based system
\end{itemize}

Why our approach better. New aspect not perform better.
\begin{itemize}
\item Spectral clustering perform dimensionaly reduction and suitable for handling high dimensional data set.
\item collective anomaly
\end{itemize}
