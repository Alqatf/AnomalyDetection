\textbf{Main point} is that \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item normalized spectral clustering converges under some very general conditions, 
\item unnormalized spectral clustering is only consistent under strong additional assumptions, 
\item thus it conclude normalized spectral clustering is superior in practical application
\end{inparaenum}
