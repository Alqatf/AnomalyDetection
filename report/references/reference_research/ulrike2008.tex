\textbf{Main point} is that \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item normalized spectral clustering converges under some very general conditions, 
\item but unnormalized spectral clustering is only consistent under strong additional assumptions, 
\end{inparaenum} thus it conclude normalized spectral clustering is superior in practical application
