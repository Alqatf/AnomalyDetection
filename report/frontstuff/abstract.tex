\section{Abstract}
Network intrusion detection system provides crucial factors for network security analysis.
The report deals with the problem of detect intrusion connections by analysing known intrusions and unknown anomalous connections.
It proposes clustering approach for detecting point and collective anomalies by analyzing similarity of the multi-dimensional data, with spectral clustering and expection-maximization algorithm.
The experiments on NSL-KDD 99 dataset validate the effectiveness in detecting both known and unknown intrusions.
