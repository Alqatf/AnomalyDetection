Network intrusion detection system is crucial for network security analysis. 
In this paper, I study the problem of detecting anomalies in network connections,
and propose a detection algorithm by measuring pairwise similarity and comparing density with previous normal connections.
The proposed algorithm offers two advantages. 
Firstly, it uses a learning algorithm with a similarity function can be adapted to the particular problem. 
Secondly, the proposed anomaly detection algorithm is automatic and with few parametric assumption on the data. 
The experiments on the NSL-KDD dataset validate the effectiveness in detecting both known and unknown types of intrusions.

% will provide a clustering approach for detecting collective anomalies by analyzing similarity of the multi-dimensional data, with spectral clustering and the Expection-Maximization algorithm.
