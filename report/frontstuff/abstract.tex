\chapter{Abstract}

The goal is to research anomaly detection based on spectral clustering. I propose clustering approach for estimating the similarity of the multi­dimensional data, with spectral clustering and expectation maximization algorithm as pre­processing step. The experiments on NSL­KDD 99 dataset will validate the effectiveness in detecting unknown anomalies.0
