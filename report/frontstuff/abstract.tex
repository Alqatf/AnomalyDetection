Network intrusion detection systems are crucial for network security analysis.
The report deals with the problem of detecting intrusion connections by analysing known intrusions and unknown anomalous connections.
It proposes a clustering approach for detecting point and collective anomalies by analyzing similarity of the multi-dimensional data, with spectral clustering and the Expection-Maximization algorithm.
The experiments on the NSL-KDD 99 dataset validate the effectiveness in detecting both known and unknown intrusions.
